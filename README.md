## Code Explanation


## Geocoding
[Geocoding](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro) is the process of converting addresses (like "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA") into geographic coordinates (like latitude 37.423021 and longitude -122.083739), which you can use to place markers on a map, or position the map and the other way around.
To get Geocoding service (**Address to location**), you need to google the following URL with the required parameters.
```
http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/outputFormat?parameters
```
This is an example of Six Flags location in Arlington, Texas. You can click the link [here](http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=2201+Road+to+Six+Flags+Arlington+TX) 
```
http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=2201+Road+to+Six+Flags+Arlington+TX
```
then we look for location in the result: 
```
 "location" : {
               "lat" : 32.75570450000001,
               "lng" : -97.07259839999999
            }
```
